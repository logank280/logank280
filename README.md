## About Me

I'm Logan, a CS student at UNB and a scripter specializing in Tycoon mechanics and Data Management.

I treat Roblox development like software engineering. I write clean, modular Luau code and use Rojo for external file management. My goal is to create systems that are not just functional, but performant and secure.

**My Tech Stack:**

Languages: Luau, C, Java

Roblox Tools: ProfileService, Knit, Rojo

Version Control: Git/GitHub

## Code Repositories To keep my workflows organized, I separate my game development from my standard software engineering work. You can view my actual code here:
